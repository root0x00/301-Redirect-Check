# 301 Redirect Check
 This Python script uses the requests library to check if a list of URLs redirects to another destination. It also logs any broken URLs or errors encountered during the process into a file for further review.

You can use https://arraythis.com/ to convert a list of URL's into an array and paste it directly into the brackets. URL = []
